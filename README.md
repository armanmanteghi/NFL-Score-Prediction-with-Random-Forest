# NFL Score Prediction with Random Forest

## Overview
This project uses a Random Forest model to predict NFL game scores. By analyzing historical game data, it creates team performance metrics (e.g., wins, losses, points scored/allowed) and uses these features to forecast scores for future matchups.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering to calculate team stats
- Predicts both home and visitor team scores for future matchups
- Model evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE) for performance assessment

## Project Structure
- **scores.csv**: The dataset containing game scores.
- **predict_scores.py**: Main script to process data, train the model, and make predictions.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/NFL-Score-Prediction.git
